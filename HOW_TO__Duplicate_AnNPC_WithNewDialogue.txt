HOW_TO__Duplicate_AnNPC_WithNewDialogue.txt

Overview, because it's too complicated to make a vid tuto for me right now.

ps this is specific to my game project.
Not really tutorial-for-plubic friendly.

I think this works!
I hope polishing camera angle,
or adding dilaogue animations
doesn't over complicate these steps.


DUPLICATE THE SCENE.TSCN FILE, NOT the node!
	Why? Cuz if you duplicate the node and edit it (ie click the movie icon),
	It'll open up the same scene file. We don't want that.
	What we want is a SEPARATE copy of the NPC, NOT a linked copy.


DUPLICATE THE DIALOGUE_NPC_INDICATOR_Spite3dNode.gd SCRIPT FILE, TOO
	Why? Cuz the dupcliate scene needs to use a different script.
	If you skip this step, then you'll have two diff npc's trying to use the same dialogue.
	Any changes you make will be changed for the 1st npc!



OPEN THE SCENE FIRST BEFORE adding npc scene to world.
	Why? Just so you won't have to rename the node a second time.
	Rename the node withint the scene.


DISCONNECT THE OLD SCRIPT AND RE-ATTACH NEW SCRIPT
	I almost forgot this step.



CHANGE THIS VAR TO THE NAME OF THE NEW TIMELINE OF DIALOGUE:
export var TIMELINE_fromDialogic = '001_TEST_Timeline'
Change the name in the apostrophes/quotes to whatever your new timeline is named.



NOTE: You can USE THE SAME ARGUMENT NAMES FOR THE SIGNALS IN DIALOGIC
	I.e. in Dialogic timeline for NPC02_two,
	The signal_arguments emitted from the timeline still say "pointCamAt_NPC1"
	even though it's the 2nd npc now.
	Still works, tho!
	P.s. I changed it to pointCamAt_NPC, ie. without "1", and I changed every other variable. It works!


REMINDER: Put a Wait Seconds event before the first signal in the dialogic timleine
	Or else the first signal won't work.




OPEN COMMON PARENT SCRIPT THAT CONNECTS THE SIGNALS
	DUPLICATE THESE LINES OF CODE:
onready var emitter_NPC01_ONE_ofSignal_nodePath = $NPC01_KinematicBodyNode/DIALOGUE_INDICATOR_Sprite3DNode

func _ready():
	##NPC01_ONE:
	emitter_NPC01_ONE_ofSignal_nodePath.connect("makeCamCurrent_CHAR", camForDIALOGUE_MainCHAR_nodePath, "CamSwitchTo_WhoeverIsTalking_function"  )
	emitter_NPC01_ONE_ofSignal_nodePath.connect("switchTo_GAME_CAM_signal", platformerCam_nodePath, 'switch_to_GAME_CAM_function')


	EDIT THE FOLLOWING:
 - the nodePath variable's name (in both the onready var and the func _ready() )
 - the actual $node_path (only in the onready var)
Iirc.
